# Android Rock-Paper-Scissors Game
 This a project made during a course.
 
 I've improoved a little to make it more friendly and cool to play, but still very simple app.
 
 Basicaly everyone knows the rules, you just have to choose with one click and the app will chose ramdomly.
 
 And then you can do it again!
